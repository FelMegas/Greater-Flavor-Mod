wyke_aycinena_convention_desc;With Central America in turmoil with filibusters, invasions and civil wars and their governments in need of weapons and logistical support, perhaps we can use this situation to expand the territory of our colony in Belize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

union_community_desc;In $YEAR$, the territory of Santo Tomás de Castilla was authorized to be administered 'in perpetuity' by the private Belgian company under the direction of King Leopold I, the 'Compagnie belge de colonisation', to replace the failed Eastern Coast of Central America Commercial and Agricultural Company. The Compagnie was formed with the aim of 'creating agricultural, industrial and commercial establishments in the various states of Central America and other places' and 'to establish commercial relations between these countries and Belgium'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC2002592088;Wyke-Aycinena Convention of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2002592088;Our foreign minister Pedro de Aycinena y PiÃ±ol has negotiated a deal with British Consul Charles Lennox Wyke. In exchange for our acknowledgement that the territory between the Belize and Sarstoon Rivers is a part of the British settlement, and not $COUNTRY$, the British will allow us to purchase needed weapons and to build a road between Ciudad de Guatemala and Belize Town to improve communication with our Atlantic coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2002592088;An Atlantic connection would greatly boost our trade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB2002592088;I don't think we'll ever get that road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2002592089;The Belgian Government has come to us with an offer to lease the territory of Santo Tomás de Castilla to the Compagnie belge de colonisation under the protection of King Leopold I of Belgium. The land is currently sparsely populated, mostly by natives, and they wish to establish a settlement there. While some view the issue pragmatically - the land is unused, and the money from the lease and connections to an European market would help our economy - others feel like it is a betrayal of the independence that was fought over not one generation ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB2002592090;On second thought, we would rather spend the money elsewhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2002592091;Disease has wrecked the colony of Santo Tomás! Many of our settlers have already perished and the crops are failing. Many of the original investors in the colony are losing interest and liquidating their assets. If the colony is to continue, we would have to buy out the plantations and infrastructure and invest more into making the colony viable long-term. But is it worth it, for a few coffee beans?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2002592091;For a few coffee beans more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2002592091;Buy them out and reinvest in the colony. The cash crops will pay for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB2002592091;Cut our losses and abandon the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2002592092;Disease has wrecked the colony of Santo Tomás. The Belgian settlers, those that survived, are returning to Belgium, and the settlements and plantations lie abandoned. While the lease of the land was perpetual, it doesn't look like they will be coming back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2002592092;The Belgians abandon Santo Tomás;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2002592092;Oh well..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
